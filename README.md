1. Which of the following is NOT a component of the CPU?

Correct answer: 2. RAM
Explanation:

CPU components are ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit).

RAM is primary memory, not part of the CPU.



---

2. What is the function of RAM in a computer?

Answer:
RAM (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU is currently using. It allows fast access to programs and improves system performance. Data in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.

3. Which of the following is a primary storage device?

Correct answer: 4. 1 and 2 both (HDD and SSD)
Explanation:
Primary storage refers to internal storage used to store OS, software, and data.


---

4. What is the purpose of a GPU?

Answer:
A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processes and renders graphics, images, and videos. It improves performance in gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and AI tasks.

5. True or False

The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer where other components are attached.
✅ True


---

6. True or False

A UPS provides emergency power when the main power source fails.
✅ True


---

7. True or False

An expansion card enhances the functionality of a computer.
✅ True

8. Explain the difference between HDD and SSD.

Feature	HDD	SSD

Technology	Magnetic disks	Flash memory
Speed	Slower	Very fast
Noise	Produces noise	Silent
Durability	Less durable	More durable
Cost	Cheaper	Costlier

9. Describe the function of BIOS.

Answer:
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) initializes hardware components during startup and loads the operating system. It also provides basic system configuration settings.


---

10. List and explain three input devices.

1. Keyboard – Used to enter text and commands


2. Mouse – Used for pointing, clicking, and navigation


3. Scanner – Converts physical documents into digital form




---

11. Identify and label components on a motherboard

CPU – Central processor of the system

RAM slots – Holds memory modules

SATA connectors – Connect storage devices

PCI-E slot – Used for GPU and expansion cards



---

12. Demonstrate how to install a RAM module.

Steps:

1. Power off the computer and unplug it


2. Open the cabinet


3. Locate RAM slots


4. Align the RAM notch with the slot


5. Press firmly until clips lock


6. Close the cabinet and power on

13. Importance of proper cooling mechanisms.

Answer:
Cooling prevents overheating, improves performance, and extends component lifespan.

Examples:

Air cooling (fans & heat sinks) – Common and cost-effective

Liquid cooling – Highly effective for gaming/high-end systems

Thermal paste – Improves heat transfer from CPU



---

14. Explain bus width and its significance.

Answer:
Bus width refers to the number of bits a bus can transmit at one time.

Wider bus = more data transfer

Improves system speed and performance


Example: 64-bit bus transfers more data than a 32-bit bus.
